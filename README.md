I created an inventory management app.
Requirements: two database tables to hold user credentials and inventory items and quanitity of items.
              Login Screen to enter a password and username, and to register for the application
              Registration screen to create your username and password, confirm said password, and add a phone number for SMS (optional)

Adressing Users Needs: The goal of this app was to adress the needs of a user who is looking for a simple and comphrensible inventory app.

Screens: Login Screen, Registration Screen (with sms) , Inventory management screen, add items screen, remove items screen.
My UI design is extremely simple and not flashy at all, I find when I use an app with too much stuff going on, I find myself not being able to properly get things done as efficiently as possible.

Well I came at the creation of the app with a plan to simply make a useable and understandable inventory app, created a UI, then did the backend for the UI i created. One thing i could have done better in my opionion, would be working on a screen at a time, instead of creating the UI and then putting in the code after. I simply overestimated my abilities, so I found myself removing uneccesary details. 

Every section I did in the XML file, I would code individually in a new .java file, add what I needed to the database and main activity, connected it with the Main.xml file, and ran it to see what worked and what did not work. 

Well I changed my UI from the original, it consisted of parts I was struggling to understand how to implement properly.

I feel as if I did really well with my login and registration aspect of my app, it flowed extremely well and looked clean aswell. I struggled with the grid view for the inventory, but sorted most of it out in the end.
